## Core Philosophy

### The Power of State
> "The difference between peak performance and poor performance is not intelligence or ability; most often it's the state that your mind and body is in." —Tony Robbins

### Key Insight
- Your emotions are NOT beyond your control
- You can learn how to change your mood—and do so in an instant
- When you're in control of your state of mind, you're the master of your emotions
- Life is happening FOR you, not TO you

## The Triad of Emotional Mastery

Tony Robbins' peak state is built on mastering three forces that control your emotions:

### 1. PHYSIOLOGY (Your Body)
**Core Principle**: How you use your body affects how you feel mentally and emotionally

**Techniques:**
- **Posture**: Stand up straight → feel proud and alert; Slump over → feel negative
- **Breathing**: Stand up and breathe deeply to reset your mind and mood
- **Movement**: Emotion is created by motion. Moving your body releases stress and elevates state
- **Exercise**: Get your heart rate up—natural mood enhancer
- **Sleep**: Give yourself enough sleep to keep mind clean and clear
- **Nutrition**: Eat foods that make you feel full, nurtured, and healthy

**Instant State Change**: Next time you're in a bad mood, stand up and breathe deeply

### 2. FOCUS (Your Attention)
**Core Principle**: "Where focus goes, energy flows"

**Techniques:**
- **Set Intention**: What you put your focus on is where you set your intention
- **Focus on Wants**: Focus on things you want and are working toward, not things holding you back
- **Priming Exercise**: Tony begins each morning with priming to set focus
- **Meditation**: Clear your mind anywhere, even at your desk
- **Exercise**: Release stress and center your focus

**Key Question**: Are you focusing on what you want or what you fear?

### 3. LANGUAGE (Your Words)
**Core Principle**: How you talk to yourself determines how you operate in the world

**Techniques:**
- **Reframe Questions**: 
  - ❌ "Why do bad things always happen to me?"
  - ✅ "What can I do to better my situation?"
- **Replace Negative Words**: Every time you say a negative word, replace it with a positive one
- **Track Your Words**: Keep track of positive vs negative words
- **Enlist Help**: Ask friends/family to help catch your negative patterns
- **Change Internal Speech**: Alter spoken patterns first, then internal speech follows

**Key Insight**: How you use language determines what emotions you feel

## The 7-Step State Change Method
